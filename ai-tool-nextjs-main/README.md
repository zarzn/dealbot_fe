### For Developement

For developement you have to save the Api-Key on the .env file with the follwing name

```

### How to change the model?

By default we are using the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.
If you want to use other model you can do that too.

To change the model, open up the template in your code editor.
Then go to the route.ts file under **ai-examples** and add your prefered model

Note: You can find all the model from here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview
