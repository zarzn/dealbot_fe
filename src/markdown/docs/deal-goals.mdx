# Setting Deal Goals

Deal Goals are one of the most powerful features of our platform. Instead of searching for specific products, you describe what you're looking for, and our AI agents actively hunt for deals that match your criteria. This guide explains how to set effective goals and manage them.

## 

### 

Deal Goals are personalized shopping objectives that you define in plain language. Unlike traditional search (which gives you immediate results) or tracking (which follows specific products), goals are ongoing searches that our AI agents actively work on for you.

For example, instead of searching for a specific laptop model, you might create a goal like:
> "I need a lightweight laptop for college with good battery life, at least 16GB RAM, and under $900."

Our AI agents then search across all marketplaces, continuously looking for deals that match your requirements. When good matches are found, you'll be notified.

### 

- **Save time**: No need to repeatedly search for the same items
- **Discover options**: Find products you might not have considered
- **Get better deals**: Our AI monitors price drops and limited-time offers
- **Express natural requirements**: Describe what you need in everyday language
- **Receive personalized suggestions**: Get recommendations tailored to your specific needs
- **Hunt while you sleep**: Our agents work 24/7 to find your perfect deals

## 

### 

1. From your dashboard, click the "Deal Goals" tab
2. Click the "Create New Goal" button
3. Give your goal a clear name (e.g., "Kitchen Blender" or "Anniversary Gift")
4. In the description field, describe what you're looking for in detail
5. Set your budget (maximum price you're willing to pay)
6. Choose a priority level (affects how actively our AI hunts)
7. Set a deadline (optional - when you need the item by)
8. Click "Create Goal"

### 

The more specific your description, the better our AI can find what you need. Include:

- **Key features**: What functionality do you need?
- **Quality expectations**: What level of quality are you looking for?
- **Brand preferences**: Do you prefer certain brands?
- **Use case**: What will you use this for?
- **Size/dimensions**: Any specific size requirements?
- **Style/color preferences**: Any aesthetic requirements?
- **Exclusions**: Anything you specifically don't want?

#### 

❌ **Poor description**: "I want a coffee maker"

✅ **Good description**: "I'm looking for a programmable coffee maker that can brew at least 10 cups. I prefer stainless steel, and it should have an auto-off feature. I don't want a single-serve machine. Budget is $150 maximum."

### 

When setting your budget:

1. Research typical prices for the items you want
2. Set a realistic but aspirational target (our AI loves a challenge!)
3. Remember that lower budgets may require more patience
4. Consider seasonal sales when timing your goals

## 

### 

1. Go to the "Deal Goals" tab on your dashboard
2. See all your active goals with their status
3. Each goal shows:
   - Number of potential matches found
   - Time remaining (if you set a deadline)
   - Last activity timestamp
   - Priority level

### 

Each goal will have one of these statuses:

- **Active**: Our AI is actively hunting
- **New Matches**: New potential deals have been found
- **Needs Review**: You have pending suggestions to review
- **On Hold**: Goal has been paused by you
- **Completed**: You've marked this goal as fulfilled
- **Expired**: Deadline has passed without completion

### 

When our AI finds potential matches:

1. You'll receive a notification based on your preferences
2. Go to your Deal Goals page and click on the goal
3. Review the suggested products in the "Matches" tab
4. For each match, you can:
   - View full details (click on the product)
   - Track the product (adds to your tracked deals)
   - Mark as "Not Interested" (helps AI refine future suggestions)
   - Mark as "Considering" (keeps it highlighted)
   - Purchase (links to the marketplace)

### 

If you're not getting the right matches:

1. Open the goal you want to update
2. Click "Edit Goal"
3. Adjust your description, budget, or other parameters
4. Add feedback in the "Additional Notes" section
5. Click "Update Goal"

The AI will immediately begin working with your updated criteria.

## 

### 

Choose how aggressively our AI hunts for deals:

- **Low Priority**: Checked a few times per week, fewer notifications
- **Medium Priority**: Daily checks, standard notifications
- **High Priority**: Multiple daily checks, more notifications
- **Urgent**: Continuous monitoring, immediate notifications

Higher priorities use more tokens from your account.

### 

Add time pressure to your hunt:

1. When creating or editing a goal, use the calendar to set a deadline
2. As the deadline approaches, the AI will:
   - Increase search frequency
   - Consider slightly higher price points
   - Suggest alternatives if exact matches aren't found
3. You'll receive a "Last Chance" notification before the deadline expires

### 

For holiday shopping or seasonal purchases:

1. Create a goal with a seasonal tag (e.g., "Black Friday" or "Back to School")
2. Our AI will factor in upcoming sales events
3. You'll receive predictions about potential deals during these events
4. The AI will be more active during the relevant season

### 

Save time with goal templates:

1. Create a goal as normal
2. At the bottom of the form, check "Save as Template"
3. Give your template a name
4. When creating future goals, select from your saved templates
5. Edit the template as needed for your new goal

## 

### 

Create goals with family members or friends:

1. When creating a goal, click "Collaborative Goal"
2. Enter the email addresses of people you want to collaborate with
3. Set permission levels (view only, can suggest, can edit)
4. Collaborators will receive an invitation email
5. All collaborators can view matches and progress
6. Great for gifts, household purchases, or group trips

### 

Create a wishlist others can see:

1. Create a goal as normal
2. Toggle "Enable as Registry Item"
3. Choose visibility (public link, friends only, etc.)
4. Share the generated link
5. Others can see what you're looking for and your budget
6. When someone purchases a registry item, it's automatically marked as completed

## 

###

1. Click on any goal, then select the "Analytics" tab
2. See metrics like:
   - Average prices found vs. your budget
   - Number of potential matches over time
   - Market trends for your desired item
   - Best marketplace sources for your goal

3. **Use natural language**: Describe your needs as you would to a friend
4. **Include context**: Explain why you need the item or how you'll use it

### 

**Electronics Goal Example:**
> "I need a noise-cancelling wireless headphone for travel. Must have at least 20 hours of battery life, comfortable for long wearing, and work well for both music and calls. I prefer neutral sound profiles, not bass-heavy. Budget is $200, but willing to pay more for exceptional quality."

**Home Appliance Goal Example:**
> "Looking for an energy-efficient refrigerator with French doors and bottom freezer. Must be counter-depth (no more than 30" deep), have an ice maker, and be fingerprint-resistant. Prefer stainless steel finish. Need by the end of the month when our kitchen renovation is complete. Budget around $1,500."

**Fashion Goal Example:**
> "I need a weatherproof men's winter jacket for Chicago winters. Must be very warm (rated for below zero temps), have a hood, and be suitable for both casual and semi-formal wear. Medium size, prefer dark colors (navy, gray, or black). Looking for reputable outdoor brands. Budget is $300."
