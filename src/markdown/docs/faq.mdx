## Searching & Finding Deals

### How does the AI search understand what I&apos;m looking for?
Our AI uses natural language processing to understand your search intent. You can search in plain language, just as you&apos;d ask a friend. For example, "gaming laptop under $800 with good battery life" will be properly interpreted.

### Why am I seeing different results from my friend for the same search?
Results are personalized based on your previous interactions with the platform, your preferences, and your location. Additionally, deals are constantly being updated, so timing can affect results.

### How often are new deals added?
Our system continuously scans supported marketplaces and updates in real-time. Most categories see dozens of new deals added every hour during peak shopping times.

### Can I search for products from specific brands?
Yes, simply include the brand name in your search query, or use the brand filter after performing a search. You can also set up specific brand preferences in your profile.

### How do I find the best deals in a specific category?
Navigate to the "Browse" section, select your desired category, and then sort by "Deal Score" to see the highest-rated deals first. Alternatively, you can use the "Top Deals" filter.

## Deal Analysis & Scoring

### What is the Deal Score and how is it calculated?
The Deal Score is our AI&apos;s assessment of a deal&apos;s quality on a scale from 1-100. It considers price history, market comparison, product quality, availability, and seasonality. Scores above 80 represent particularly good value.

### How accurate is the price history information?
Our price history data is collected from multiple sources and verified for accuracy. For most major retailers, we have price data going back at least 12 months. Note that some marketplace limitations may affect data completeness.

### What does "Buy Now" vs "Wait" recommendation mean?
These recommendations are based on price trends and predictive analysis. "Buy Now" indicates the current price is exceptional or unlikely to drop further soon. "Wait" suggests the price is likely to drop based on historical patterns.

### Can I customize how deals are analyzed for my needs?
Yes, premium users can adjust the weighting of different factors in the deal analysis. For example, you can prioritize price over features, or emphasize certain product aspects that matter more to you.

### Why does a deal have a high score but still say "Wait"?
A high score means it&apos;s a good value relative to market price, but "Wait" indicates our predictive analysis suggests the price might drop further soon, perhaps due to an upcoming sales event or historical price patterns.

## Tracking Deals

### How many deals can I track?
Free accounts can track up to 3 deals simultaneously. Standard subscribers can track up to 25 deals, Plus subscribers up to 100 deals, and Premium subscribers have unlimited tracking.

### Will I be notified if a tracked deal sells out?
Yes, by default you&apos;ll receive notifications when tracked deals sell out or are about to expire. You can customize these alerts in your notification settings.

### How do I set a target price for tracking?
When tracking a deal, you&apos;ll see an option to set a target price. You&apos;ll receive a notification when the price drops to or below your target. You can modify target prices any time from your Tracked Deals dashboard.

### Can I share my tracked deals list with someone else?
Yes, you can share individual tracked deals or entire tracking lists. In your Tracked Deals dashboard, select the items you want to share and click the "Share" button for options.

### What happens to expired tracked deals?
Expired deals remain in your tracking list for 30 days, marked as expired, so you can review them. After 30 days, they&apos;re automatically moved to your tracking history, which you can still access.

---

## Deal Goals

### What&apos;s the difference between tracking a deal and setting a goal?
Tracking focuses on specific products you&apos;ve already found, while goals describe what you&apos;re looking for in general terms. Goals actively search for matching products across marketplaces using AI agents.

### How specific should my goal description be?
Be as specific as necessary for your needs. You can be very detailed ("13-inch laptop with at least 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and Thunderbolt ports under $1200") or more general ("comfortable running shoes for wide feet"). More specific goals typically yield more accurate results.

### How many active goals can I have?
Free accounts can have 1 active goal. Standard subscribers can have 3 active goals, Plus subscribers 5 active goals, and Premium subscribers 10 active goals.

### Do goals expire if I don&apos;t act on them?
Goals remain active until you pause or complete them. However, if you don&apos;t interact with goal recommendations for 30 days, the goal will be automatically paused to conserve system resources. You can resume it at any time.

### Can I edit a goal after creating it?
Yes, you can edit any aspect of your goals at any time. Our AI will immediately adjust its search strategy based on your changes.

## Token System

### How do I earn tokens?
You can earn tokens through daily logins, completing profile tasks, participating in weekly challenges, contributing to the community by reporting good deals, and referring new users.

### Do tokens expire?
Free tokens earned through platform activities expire after 90 days. Subscription tokens expire after 60 days. Purchased tokens never expire.

### What&apos;s the best way to use my tokens?
Save tokens for high-value features like in-depth analysis of expensive purchases, setting goals for important items, or accessing premium data for major buying decisions. Basic features like searching and browsing don&apos;t require tokens.

### Can I transfer tokens to another user?
Yes, you can send tokens to other users from your Wallet page. There&apos;s a small transfer fee (5% of the transferred amount), and a minimum transfer of 10 tokens.

### What happens if I run out of tokens?
You&apos;ll still have access to all free features. For premium features, you&apos;ll be prompted to earn or purchase more tokens when you try to use them.

## Sharing & Social Features

### Can people see what deals I&apos;ve viewed if I share with them?
No, sharing only shows the specific deals you choose to share. Your browsing history and other tracked deals remain private unless you explicitly share them.

### How do I know if someone viewed my shared deal?
In your Shared Deals dashboard, you can see view counts for each shared item. Click on any shared deal to see more detailed analytics about views and engagement.

### Can I add my own comments when sharing a deal?
Yes, the Share Dialog allows you to add a custom title, description, and personal notes to provide context and your thoughts on the deal.

### Do shared deals update if the price changes?
Yes, shared deals show real-time information. If the price changes or the deal expires, anyone viewing your shared link will see the current status.

### Can I remove a shared deal after posting it?
Yes, you can deactivate any shared link from your Shared Deals dashboard. Once deactivated, the link will no longer work, and it will be removed from your public profile.

## Notifications

### How do I control what notifications I receive?
Go to Account Settings > Notifications to customize all notification types. You can enable or disable specific notifications and choose how you receive them (email, browser, mobile push).

### Why am I not receiving email notifications?
First check your spam folder. If you still don&apos;t see notifications, verify your email address is correct in your profile settings. You can also try re-enabling notifications in your account settings.

### Can I set quiet hours for notifications?
Yes, in your notification settings, you can set "Quiet Hours" when you won&apos;t receive push or browser notifications. Email digests will still be delivered based on your selected schedule.

### How do I get notified about specific types of deals?
Create a saved search or deal goal with your specific criteria, and enable notifications for it. You&apos;ll be alerted when new matching deals are found.

### Can I get notifications for flash deals?
Yes, enable "Flash Deal Alerts" in your notification settings. You can customize these to only notify you for categories you&apos;re interested in and deal scores above a threshold you set.
