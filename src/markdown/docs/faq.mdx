# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is the AI Agentic Deals System?

The AI Agentic Deals System is a platform that uses artificial intelligence to find, analyze, and present the best deals from across multiple marketplaces. Our system leverages advanced AI agents to scrape data, analyze deals, and provide personalized recommendations based on your preferences.

### How does the AI work?

Our system uses a combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) like DeepSeek and GPT-4, along with specialized algorithms for deal analysis. The AI agents can understand natural language queries, extract relevant deal information from various sources, analyze pricing trends, and provide insights on deal quality.

### Is the service free to use?

The platform operates on a token-based system. Basic features are available with a minimal token balance, while more advanced features may require additional tokens. New users receive a starter token balance upon registration.

## Account Management

### How do I create an account?

Visit the [signup page](/auth/signup) and complete the registration form. You'll need a valid email address to verify your account. Optionally, you can connect a Solana wallet for token management.

### Can I use the platform without a cryptocurrency wallet?

Yes, you can use most features without connecting a cryptocurrency wallet. However, to purchase and manage tokens, a compatible Solana wallet is required.

### How do I reset my password?

Go to the [forgot password page](/auth/forgot-password), enter your email address, and follow the instructions sent to your email to reset your password.
