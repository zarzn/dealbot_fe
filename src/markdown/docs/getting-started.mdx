Welcome to RebatOn! This guide will walk you through your first steps with our platform so you can start finding incredible deals right away.

## What is RebatOn?

RebatOn is your personal shopping assistant that uses artificial intelligence to find the best deals across multiple online marketplaces. Unlike traditional deal sites, our AI continuously searches for products that match your interests and budget, analyzes pricing to determine if it&apos;s truly a good deal, and notifies you when it&apos;s the perfect time to buy.

## Your First Login

3. Complete your **Profile** to help our AI understand your preferences
4. Browse the **Featured Deals** section to see what&apos;s currently trending

## Finding Deals

There are several ways to discover deals on our platform:

### Using the Search Bar

The search bar at the top of every page is your most powerful tool:

1. Type in what you&apos;re looking for using natural language
   - Example: "wireless headphones under $100 with noise cancellation"
   - Example: "best gaming laptop deals with RTX graphics"

2. Our AI will interpret your request and search across Amazon, Walmart, eBay, and more

3. Results are automatically sorted by our AI-powered deal score which considers:
   - Price compared to historical data
   - Product quality and reviews
   - Overall value for money

### Browsing Categories

If you prefer to explore:

1. Visit the **Browse** section from the main navigation
2. Select a category that interests you
3. Use the filters to narrow down results by price range, brand, or other attributes
