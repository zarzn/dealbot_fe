# Searching for Deals

Our AI-powered deal search engine helps you discover the best deals across multiple marketplaces. This guide will show you how to use all the search features to find exactly what you're looking for.

## 

### 

The search bar at the top of every page is your starting point for finding deals:

1. Click the search bar and type what you're looking for
2. As you type, you'll see suggested products and categories
3. Press Enter or click the search icon to see full results
4. Results are automatically sorted by our Deal Score (best deals first)

### 

- **Be specific but not too narrow**: "wireless headphones under $100" works better than "Sony WH-1000XM4"
- **Include important features**: "4K TV 65 inch OLED" helps find exactly what you want
- **Use price ranges**: Include "under $X" or "$X-$Y" to see deals in your budget
- **Specify brands**: Add brand names if you have preferences

## 

### 

Our search understands special operators to refine your results:

- **Quotation marks** for exact phrases: `"smart watch with heart rate monitor"`
- **Minus sign** to exclude terms: `laptop -gaming` (laptops that aren't gaming-specific)
- **OR** between terms: `(sony OR bose) headphones` (shows headphones from either brand)
- **AND** to require specific terms: `tablet AND stylus AND "drawing"`

### 

After performing a search:
