## 

We take sharing privacy seriously:

- **Link Tracking**: Shared links contain anonymous tracking codes

### 

**Issue**: Shared link shows "Expired" or "Not Found"
**Solution**: The deal may have ended or been removed. Try sharing a new deal.

**Issue**: Recipients report they can't see personal notes
**Solution**: Remind them to log in - personal notes are only visible to authenticated users.

**Issue**: Share analytics not updating
**Solution**: Analytics may take up to 30 minutes to update. Check back later.

**Issue**: Social sharing buttons not working
**Solution**: Try using the link option instead, or check browser permissions for popups.
