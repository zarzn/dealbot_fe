# Token System

Our platform uses a token-based economy to provide access to premium features while keeping basic functionality free for everyone. This guide explains how tokens work, how to earn them, and the best ways to use them.

---

## What Are Tokens?

Tokens are the virtual currency of our platform that power premium features:

- Tokens give you access to advanced AI analysis
- They enable premium functionality like deal goals and advanced filtering
- They represent computational resources used by our AI systems
- They allow us to allocate processing power fairly among users
- They create an economy where you can earn by contributing to the community

Each token has a fixed value in terms of the computational resources it provides access to.
