# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides solutions for common issues you might encounter while using the AI Agentic Deals System.

## Authentication Issues

### I can't log in to my account

If you're unable to log in, try these solutions:

1. **Verify your credentials**
   - Double-check your email address and password
   - Ensure Caps Lock is not enabled
   - Try resetting your password via the [forgot password page](/auth/forgot-password)

2. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
   - This resolves many authentication issues related to cached data
   - In Chrome: Settings → Privacy and Security → Clear browsing data
   - In Firefox: Options → Privacy & Security → Cookies and Site Data → Clear Data

3. **Check your email for verification**
   - New accounts require email verification
   - Check your spam/junk folder for the verification email
   - Request a new verification email from the login page

### My session keeps expiring

If you're frequently logged out:

1. **Check your browser settings**
   - Ensure your browser isn't set to clear cookies when closed
   - Verify that you haven't enabled "private browsing" or "incognito" mode

2. **Update your browser**
   - Outdated browsers may have issues with JWT token handling
   - Make sure you're using the latest version of your browser

## Wallet Connection Issues

### I can't connect my Solana wallet

Common Solana wallet connection issues:

1. **Browser extension not detected**
   - Ensure the wallet extension (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) is installed
   - Try refreshing the page after making sure the extension is unlocked

2. **Wrong network selected**
   - Open your wallet and ensure it's connected to the correct network (Mainnet Beta)
   - The platform will not recognize wallets connected to Devnet or Testnet

3. **Permission denied**
   - If you previously denied connection permission, you'll need to reset it
   - Check your wallet settings for site permissions

### My token balance isn't updating

If your token balance appears incorrect:

1. **Network congestion**
   - During periods of high network activity, transactions may be delayed
   - Wait a few minutes and refresh the page

2. **Transaction failed**
   - Check your wallet's transaction history to see if the transaction failed
   - Look for error messages in the transaction details

## Deal Search Issues

### My searches return no results

If you're not seeing any deals:

1. **Search terms too specific**
   - Try using more general terms (e.g., "laptops" instead of specific model numbers)
   - Remove specific filters that might be too restrictive

2. **Token balance insufficient**
   - Some searches require a minimum token balance
   - Check your wallet section to verify your current balance

3. **Temporary API issues**
   - Our scrapers occasionally encounter rate limiting from marketplaces
   - Try again in a few minutes or search a different category

### Deal analysis is not working

If deal analysis features aren't functioning:

1. **AI service temporarily unavailable**
   - Our AI services occasionally undergo maintenance
   - Try again later or check our status page for updates

2. **Insufficient data for analysis**
   - Some deals may not have enough historical data for comprehensive analysis
   - Try analyzing more popular products with longer price histories

## WebSocket Connection Issues

### Real-time updates not working

If you're not receiving real-time updates:

1. **Check internet connection**
   - WebSocket connections require a stable internet connection
   - Try connecting to a different network if available

2. **Firewall or proxy blocking WebSockets**
   - Some network configurations block WebSocket connections
   - Try using a different network without strict firewall rules

3. **Manually reconnect**
   - Log out and log back in to re-establish the WebSocket connection
   - Refresh the page to attempt reconnection

## Performance Issues

### The application is slow or unresponsive

If the platform is performing poorly:

1. **Check your internet connection**
   - Run a speed test to verify your connection is stable
   - Try connecting to a different network if available

2. **Clear browser cache**
   - Accumulated cache can slow down web applications
   - Clear your browser's cache and temporary files

3. **Close unused tabs and applications**
   - Limited system resources can impact performance
   - Close other resource-intensive applications and browser tabs

4. **Try a different browser**
   - If issues persist, try accessing the platform in a different browser
   - Chrome and Firefox generally provide the best performance

## Mobile-Specific Issues

### Display problems on mobile devices

If the interface doesn't display correctly on your mobile device:

1. **Use landscape orientation**
   - Some complex features display better in landscape mode
   - Try rotating your device

2. **Enable desktop mode**
   - For tablets or larger phones, request the desktop site
   - In most mobile browsers, this option is in the menu or settings

3. **Update your mobile browser**
   - Older mobile browsers may have compatibility issues
   - Update to the latest version available

## Account Management Issues

### I didn't receive verification email

If you didn't receive your verification email:

1. **Check spam/junk folders**
   - Verification emails are sometimes filtered as spam
   - Add our domain to your safe senders list

2. **Verify email address**
   - Make sure you entered your email address correctly
   - Request a new verification email from the login page

### I can't update my profile

If you're unable to update your profile information:

1. **Check required fields**
   - All required fields must be completed
   - Look for error messages indicating missing information

2. **Session timeout**
   - Your session may have expired during a long form edit
   - Log in again and try updating your profile
