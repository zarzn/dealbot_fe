# Understanding Deal Analysis

When you view a deal on our platform, you'll notice comprehensive analysis information that helps you determine if it's truly a good value. This guide explains what each element means and how to use this information to make smarter shopping decisions.

## 

The Deal Score is our AI's overall assessment of a deal's quality on a scale from 1 to 100:

- **90-100**: Exceptional deal (rarely seen, act quickly)
- **80-89**: Excellent deal (significantly better than usual)
- **70-79**: Good deal (better than average)
- **60-69**: Decent deal (somewhat better than usual)
- **Below 60**: Average or below-average deal

The score is calculated based on several factors:

- **Price history** (how current price compares to historical data)
- **Market comparison** (how price compares to similar products)
- **Product quality** (based on reviews and specifications)
- **Deal availability** (how limited or widespread the offer is)
- **Seasonality** (whether it's a good time to buy this type of product)

## 

The price history chart shows how the current price compares to past prices:

Key elements to look for:

- **Current price line** (bold) compared to historical prices
- **Historical low point** (marked with a dot)
- **Average price** (shown as a dotted line)
- **Price trends** (whether the price has been rising, falling, or stable)
- **Special events** (sales events like Black Friday marked on the timeline)

You can adjust the chart to show different time periods:
- 30 Days
- 90 Days
- 6 Months
- 1 Year
- All Time

## 

This section compares the current price with:

- **Historical Average**: The average price over the past 90 days
- **Historical Low**: The lowest recorded price and when it occurred
- **Historical High**: The highest recorded price and when it occurred
- **Suggested Retail Price**: The manufacturer's suggested price
- **Similar Products Average**: What comparable products typically cost

Look for the **"Price Position"** indicator, which shows if the current price is:
- All-time low
- Near all-time low (within 5%)
- Lower than average
- Average
- Higher than average

## 

Our AI analyzes pricing patterns to recommend whether you should:

- **Buy Now**: Price is exceptional or unlikely to drop further soon
- **Consider**: Price is good but not exceptional
- **Wait**: Price is likely to drop further based on historical patterns

This recommendation includes an explanation of the reasoning, such as:
- "This is the lowest price we've seen in 6 months"
- "This product typically drops in price around Black Friday"
- "Similar models have recently been discounted more heavily"

## 

The Value Breakdown shows how the product's features compare to its price:

This visualization uses a radar chart to show:
- How each key feature compares to the average for this price point
- Where the product over-delivers or under-delivers on value
- Overall value proposition (the area covered by the chart)

Larger covered areas indicate better overall value for money.

## 

This section shows comparable products with their:
- Price
- Deal Score
- Key differentiating features
- Links to view those deals

Use this to quickly see if there are better alternatives available.

## 

The Market Insights tab provides additional context:

- **Price Volatility**: How frequently and dramatically the price changes
- **Seasonal Patterns**: When prices for this type of product typically drop
- **Stock Availability**: How likely the deal is to remain available
- **Retailer Reliability**: History of the seller's deal fulfillment
- **Return Policy**: Summary of return terms for this purchase

## 

User comments provide real-world experiences:
- Previous purchasers sharing their experience
- Notes about shipping times or customer service
- Tips for maximizing value (like available rebates or bundling options)

You can sort comments by:
- Most helpful
- Most recent
- Highest rated

## 

Here's how to use all this information effectively:

1. **Check the Deal Score first** for a quick assessment
2. **Look at the price history** to see if this is truly a good time to buy
3. **Review the Buy Now or Wait recommendation** for timing guidance
4. **Examine the Value Breakdown** to ensure the product meets your needs
5. **Compare with similar products** to confirm you're getting the best option
6. **Read user comments** for real-world experience

##
